Crescendo ⚔️
Amplify your productivity. Level up your life.

Crescendo is a web application that transforms your daily tasks and long-term goals into a rewarding medieval fantasy adventure. It's a productivity app designed for those who want to make self-improvement feel less like a chore and more like a game.

About the Project
Built with a passion for both productivity and RPGs, Crescendo applies gamification principles to help you build habits, track progress, and achieve your real-world goals. After taking a short quiz to determine your character class (Knight, Samurai, or Ninja), you can create "Quests" (your to-do items) and complete them to gain experience points, level up, and improve your character's stats.

This repository contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), built with a Python/Django backend and a clean, dynamic frontend using vanilla JavaScript.

Core Features (MVP)
Class System: An initial quiz assigns users a class that reflects their personality.

Gamified Quests: A flexible to-do list system where tasks are "Quests" with varying difficulty levels (Brawl, Raid, Battle).

XP & Leveling: Completing quests grants experience points (XP), allowing you to level up and earn new subclass titles (e.g., Squire ➡️ Cavalier).

"Teaser" Stats System: A functional system for tracking core character stats like Strength and Intelligence, with placeholder milestones to prove the concept.

Full User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and session management.

Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Django

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript

Database: SQLite (for development)

Future Goals (Project Crescendo V2)
The long-term vision for Crescendo includes:

A fully developed, multi-faceted stats system with hundreds of pre-defined milestones.

Adaptive productivity tips and app behavior based on the user's class.

Social features, allowing users to form parties and tackle quests together.
